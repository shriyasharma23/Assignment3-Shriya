# Assignment 3 - Shriya Sharma

This repository contains three coding assignments implemented in Python, C++, and Java. Each task demonstrates object-oriented programming, file handling, and exception management in their respective languages.

## Q1 - Get Hardware Info (Python)

### Problem Statement
A Python program that displays real-time hardware information of the system using object-oriented programming principles.

### Approach
- A parent abstract class `HostInfo` is created with common attributes like hostname, memory, cpu, ip, and disk_size.
- An abstract method `get_hardware_info()` is defined in the parent class which must be implemented by every child class.
- Two child classes `LinuxHost` and `WindowsHost` inherit from `HostInfo` and implement `get_hardware_info()` using OS-specific commands.
- `LinuxHost` uses commands like `free`, `lscpu`, and `df` to fetch hardware details.
- `WindowsHost` uses `systeminfo` and `wmic` commands to fetch hardware details.
- A common method `display_hardware_info()` in the parent class displays all collected info in JSON format.
- The main script detects the current OS using `platform.system()` and instantiates the appropriate child class automatically.

### Project Structure
```
q1_hardware_info/
├── host_info.py       # Abstract parent class
├── linux_host.py      # Child class for Linux
├── windows_host.py    # Child class for Windows
└── main.py            # Entry point
```

### How to Run
```bash
cd q1_hardware_info
python main.py
```

### Sample Output
```json
{
    "hostname": "DESKTOP-ABC123",
    "ip": "192.168.1.10",
    "memory": "8 GB",
    "cpu": "Intel Core i5",
    "disk_size": "512 GB"
}
```

## Q2 - Filter Inventory Data (C++)

### Problem Statement
A C++ program that reads inventory data from a JSON file and filters it based on given criteria using object-oriented design.

### Approach
- A `Host` struct stores all details of a single machine — ip, os, memory, cpu, and disk.
- The JSON file is parsed line by line without any external library, extracting values for each known key.
- Numeric values like "4GB" and "3.8Ghz" are handled by stripping the unit characters and comparing only the numeric part.
- An `InventoryFilter` class handles all filtering logic with separate private methods for each filter type.
- The program supports four filter criteria — Memory, CPU, Linux, and Windows.
- If filter criteria is Memory or CPU, the host with the maximum value is displayed.
- If filter criteria is Linux or Windows, all hosts matching that OS are displayed.
- Exceptions are raised if filter criteria is missing or invalid.

### Project Structure
```
q2_inventory_filter/
├── main.cpp           # Main program with all classes
└── inventory.json     # Input inventory data file
```

### How to Run
```bash
cd q2_inventory_filter
g++ -o inventory main.cpp -std=c++17
.\inventory.exe Memory
.\inventory.exe CPU
.\inventory.exe Linux
.\inventory.exe Windows
```

### Filter Criteria
| Criteria | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Memory   | Displays host with maximum RAM |
| CPU      | Displays host with maximum CPU speed |
| Linux    | Displays all hosts running Linux |
| Windows  | Displays all hosts running Windows |

## Q3 - Log File Parsing (Java)

### Problem Statement
A Java program that parses a log file and returns the most recent log entries based on log type and count.

### Approach
- The program accepts three inputs — file path, number of lines to display, and log types to filter.
- Number of lines defaults to 10 and log type defaults to "error" if not provided.
- The log file is read and scanned from bottom to top so that the most recent logs are picked first.
- Each log line starts with a type in square brackets like [INFO], [DEBUG], [ERROR], [WARNING].
- The program extracts the type from inside the brackets and matches it against the requested types.
- Multiple log types can be provided as comma separated values like "info,debug".
- Exceptions are raised if the file path is invalid or if an invalid log type is provided.
- Results are reversed before display so output appears in chronological order.

### Project Structure
```
q3_log_parser/
├── LogParser.java                  # Main Java program
└── Log_19_10_17_11_42_01.log      # Sample log file
```

### How to Run
```bash
cd Assignment3-Shriya
javac q3_log_parser/LogParser.java
java q3_log_parser.LogParser q3_log_parser/Log_19_10_17_11_42_01.log 10 info
```

### Input Parameters
| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| File Path | Yes      | None    | Path to the log file |
| Num Lines | No       | 10      | Number of recent logs to display |
| Log Types | No       | error   | Comma separated log types to filter |

### Valid Log Types
`error` , `warning` , `info` , `debug`
